# Assessment

## Installation & run

- Install .NET Core 2.2
- Open a terminal in `src/Pokedex`
- Run `dotnet run`
- Visit `http://localhost:5000/swagger` to see the API
  documentation
- Create your frontend in the the folder `src/Frontend`

## Assement

Use the REST API to show the pokemons on a web page. You must be able to catch the pokemons for your own pokedex. You could use Angular, Vue, React, Polymer or JavaScript for this.

Use your own creativity for the styling of the application.

We expect that youâ€™ll need about 3 to 5 hours for the assessment. If you're running out of time, let us know what you wanted to do, but didn't have time for.

**NOTE**: Please do not use a generator (like yeoman), because then it is very difficult for us to determine what you have written yourself and what parts are generated.

We judge the solution on:

- the overall approach you took to the assignment
- the architecture of the solution and the technologies used
- your solution for the use case

I you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask them at w.loth@arcady.nl or s.koster@arcady.nl.

Good luck with the assignment!
