## Assessment

I have the fronten deployed on Vercel... But I have no clue (time rather) to check how to deploy the backend. cloning the repo and running it locally is worth it!

The front-end solution of choice is NextJS (14.2.4) with TypeScript.

To run the frontend, simply run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
## or replace pnpm with npm or yarn, but... I scaffolded the project with pnpm
```
